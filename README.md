🚀 Marketing Analytics Portfolio Project – Power BI Dashboard 📊

Marketing success isn’t just about great campaigns, it’s about data-driven decisions! In my latest Marketing Analytics Portfolio Project, I built a Power BI dashboard to analyze key trends in conversion rates, customer engagement, and feedback. Here’s what I uncovered:

🔹 Conversion Insights: Peaks & Opportunities
✅ January saw the highest conversion rate (18.5%), driven by Ski Boots (150% conversion!)—a clear seasonal trend.
❌ May had the lowest conversion (4.3%), with no standout products, signaling a need for better promotions.
💡 Action: Focus on high-performing products like Kayaks & Baseball Gloves in peak months while implementing targeted discounts in slower months.

🔹 Customer Engagement: Declining Views, Strong CTR
📉 Views peaked in February & July, then declined post-August.
🖱️ 15.37% Click-Through Rate (CTR)—while clicks & likes are low, engaged users are taking action.
📢 Blog content performed best, surpassing social media & video engagement.
💡 Action: Experiment with interactive content, stronger CTAs, and user-generated content to sustain engagement year-round.

🔹 Customer Feedback: Good, But Not Great
⭐ Average rating: 3.7 (below the 4.0 target)—suggesting room for improvement.
✅ 275 reviews had positive sentiment, but 82 reviews were negative, indicating key pain points.
💡 Action: Implement a feedback loop to address negative reviews, improve weak areas, and engage with customers to boost satisfaction & ratings.

📊 Takeaways from this Power BI project:
📌 Leverage seasonal marketing for maximum conversions.
📌 Refine content strategy to sustain engagement beyond peak months.
📌 Enhance customer satisfaction by addressing common review concerns.
Data tells a story, and this dashboard helps businesses turn insights into action! 🚀
